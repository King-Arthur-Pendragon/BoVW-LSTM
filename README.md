Bag of Visual Words Image Feature Generator
============================================

This is an implementation of [bag of visual words model][1] in Python for feature extraction in videos.

The current repository is just one layer of a framework for video classification, composed by:
- Bag-of-Visual-Words ( Feature extraction for each frame) 
- Long-Short Term Memory ( Maximizing Temporal Dependencies of features)
- Softmax Classifier ( Classify the video, given the outputs of LSTM)

The approach consists of process an input video, dividing it into sequence of frames and saving these images in a folder that 
represents the class of the video. After this we extract the features for each image into the folder of video, generating a Histogram
of Visual Words belonging to each image. The first part is done by [`process_video.py`][2] and the second by [`feature_extraction.py`][3]

The script `feature_extraction.py` will generate a visual vocabulary using the images provided by process_video.py.

The feature extraction consists of:

1. Extracting local features of all datasets
2. Generating a codebook of visual words with clustering of the features
3. Aggregating the histograms of the visual words for each of the traning images

This code relies on:

 - SIFT features for local features
 - k-means for generation of the words via clustering

### Example use:
  
You can extract the features of each video frame for a specific video with: 

    python feature_extraction.py path_to_folders_with_video_frames

The dataset should have following structure, where all the video frames belonging to one class are in the same folder:

    .
    |-- path_to_folders_with_video_frames
    |    |-- class1
    |    |-- class2
    |    |-- class3
    ...
    |    â””-- classN

### Prerequisites:

To install the necessary libraries run following code from working directory:
    
    # installing sift
    wget http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~lowe/keypoints/siftDemoV4.zip
    unzip siftDemoV4.zip
    cp sift*/sift sift
    

#### Notes
If you get an `IOError: SIFT executable not found` error, try `sudo apt-get install libc6-i386`.
